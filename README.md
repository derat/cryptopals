# cryptopals solutions in Go

This repository contains my solutions to the [Cryptopals.com Crypto Challenges],
written in [Go].

I'd started solving these a few years ago (back when they were called the
"Matasano Crypto Challenges") but got sidetracked after a set or two, so I'm
starting again from the beginning now.

I'd recommend trying to solve these on your own first -- they're a lot of fun!
